# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **`provideStrctWizardDefaults({ vertical: true })`** — flip the wizard's
  default app-wide, for the house rule "steps are always vertical". A bound
  `[vertical]` on an instance still wins (so `[vertical]="false"` remains
  the explicit opt-out), and without the provider the default stays
  horizontal — the semver contract holds.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — vertical wizard

- **`strct-wizard vertical`** — steps become a left rail, per the approved
  design: dashed-ring states (idle ⊙ / active ●⊙ / done ✓ in success green),
  a rail `title`, a progress bar with an "n/N completed" counter (furthest
  step reached, remembered across back-navigation), per-step `description`
  sublabels revealed on the active step, and click-back navigation to
  visited steps (`goTo(index)` public; forward moves still gate through
  Next / `canAdvance`).
- **`strctWizardAside`** — an optional right column beside the vertical
  wizard for live summaries / impact meters; hides first as the component
  narrows.
- **Never flips horizontal** — container queries collapse the rail to a
  56px compact vertical ring column (with connector line) under ~720px of
  component width; the aside yields at ~800px.
- Localizable strings completed: `cancelLabel`, `submittingLabel`,
  `progressLabel`, `stepsLabel` (Cancel / "Submitting…" were hard-coded).
- The horizontal default is visually and behaviorally untouched.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — consumer-reported gaps (FR-16-04…07)

- **`strct-datagrid` `quickFilterAlign`** — the built-in quick-filter box
  now sits at the toolbar's END by default (action verbs lead on the left,
  view controls right — the vCenter/Grafana/GitHub convention, and a stable
  position across grids whose button sets differ). `'start'` restores the
  old order.
- **`strct-input-otp` `autofocus` + `focus(index = 0)`** — focus box 0
  declaratively when the second-factor step appears, and refocus
  programmatically after a rejected code — no more DOM-reach workarounds.
- **`strct-input-otp` `groupSize`** — a separator every N boxes
  (`groupSize=3` ⇒ `nnn – nnn`), mirroring how authenticator apps display
  the code. Separators are `aria-hidden`; keyboarding is untouched.
- **Loading skeletons read as loading** — the opacity pulse on `--bg-3` was
  near-invisible on dark themes ("I see 5–6 EMPTY rows while it loads").
  `strct-datagrid`, `strct-table` and `strct-skeleton` now share one moving
  sweep with a `--skeleton-hi` highlight token (default `--acc18`);
  `prefers-reduced-motion` gets a static highlight bar instead. No API
  change.

### Docs

- `docs/feature-requests/` gained an `archive/` (13 fully-shipped FR
  documents moved in) and a status ledger README mapping every FR to the
  release that shipped it.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — consumer-reported gaps (FR-16-01 + singleLine reveal)

- **`strct-icon` `strictName`** — the compile-time opt-in the icon note asked
  for: typed as the bare `StrctIconName` union, so a mistyped built-in name
  (`strictName="sheildCheck"`) fails the BUILD under strict templates. Wins
  over `name` when both are set; `name` (now optional, unchanged behavior)
  stays the escape hatch for runtime-registered custom icons.
- **`strct-datagrid` singleLine truncation reveal** — hovering (or keyboard-
  focusing into) a cell whose content is actually clipped reveals the full
  text as a native `title`. Hover-lazy: one delegated tbody listener, zero
  render cost, so virtual grids pay nothing for unhovered cells. Covers
  plain and `strctCell`-templated cells alike via `textContent`, clears the
  title again after a column resize, and cells that fit get none.
  `singleLine` off ⇒ behavior completely unchanged.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — consumer-reported gaps (FR-16-02 / FR-16-03)

- **`strct-datagrid` global quick filter** — the console-standard "filter
  this list fast" box, owned by the grid: two-way `quickFilter` OR-substring-
  matches one term across every column (`quickFilterFields` restricts the
  scan — skip opaque ids), ANDs with the per-column `filters`, resets paging
  and rides on `(lazyLoad)` in server mode. Opt-in `quickFilterable` renders
  the built-in toolbar searchbox with a "filtered / total" count, and the
  grid-owned term keeps selection/expansion identity across keystrokes —
  the three things the feed-it-filtered-rows stopgap could not do. Works in
  tree mode too (matches keep their ancestors, force-expanded).
- **`strct-time-range` `size`** — `'sm' | 'md'` (default `'md'`) forwarded
  to the trigger button, so the picker lines up inside `size="sm"` toolbars
  next to Live / Refresh buttons.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **`strct-dropdown` popover-attribute collision** — the static `popover`
  attribute collides with the native HTML Popover API, so the UA styled the
  host (Canvas background, medium border): the white frame around
  `strct-time-range`'s trigger in dark themes. The component now strips the
  DOM attribute after Angular reads the input — same API, no UA styling.
- **`strct-split-button` segment misalignment** — the chevron lives inside
  the dropdown's trigger wrapper and didn't stretch, rendering 4px shorter
  than the main segment (stepped, broken join). Both wrapper layers now
  stretch; segments join seamlessly in outline and solid looks.

### Added

- **`rocket` glyph** (deploy/launch — 181 icons). The split-button demo
  referenced it before it existed; the icon set's own dev warning flagged it.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Native widgets now follow the theme** — the token layer declares
  `color-scheme: dark/light` on `[data-theme]`, so datetime/date fields,
  their popup calendars, select dropdowns, scrollbars and autofill render in
  the theme's scheme. Previously the page darkened via CSS while Chromium
  kept painting native UI in the light system scheme — the white fields the
  time-range picker showed in dark mode. `strct-time-range`'s inputs now
  inherit the root scheme instead of a local `light dark`.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added — platform DX (Material / Blueprint infrastructure)

- **`StrctAnnouncer`** — screen-reader live announcements as a root service
  (Material's LiveAnnouncer pattern): hidden polite/assertive regions,
  clear-then-set so identical messages re-announce, 10s stale wipe.
- **`StrctHotkeysService` + `<strct-hotkeys-help/>`** — centrally registered
  application hotkeys (Blueprint pattern): `mod+k`-style combos (mod =
  Ctrl/⌘), plain keys suppressed while typing, dispose-function
  unregistration — plus the `?` cheatsheet overlay listing everything,
  grouped. The docs site dogfoods it (`?` anywhere).
- **`[strctReorder]` / `[strctReorderItem]`** — list drag-reorder primitive:
  HTML5 drag plus Alt+↑/↓ keyboard moves; emits `(reordered) { from, to }`
  and never touches the consumer's array; styling hooks via
  `--dragging`/`--over` classes.

The theme playground (palette generator + CSS token export) requested with
this package already shipped earlier — see /theme-playground on the docs
site.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added — component tour (Ant / Carbon / Fluent / Blueprint gaps)

Six new components; the set is now 79:

- **`strct-splitter`** — two resizable panes with a draggable gutter
  (`strctPaneStart` / `strctPaneEnd`, two-way `split` %, `min`/`max` clamps,
  `vertical`); the gutter is a keyboard `role="separator"` with
  aria-valuenow/min/max, arrow nudge and Home/End.
- **`strct-transfer`** — dual-list picklist ("assign hosts to the cluster"):
  checkbox multi-select, per-side searchboxes, move buttons, two-way
  `assigned` id set, `(moved)` events.
- **`strct-split-button`** — main action + chevron of variants
  (`StrctMenuItem[]` with icons/dividers/critical); `(action)` / `(picked)`;
  outline and `solid` looks.
- **`strct-menubar`** — the "VM · Host · Cluster" application-menu strip:
  APG menubar keyboarding (roving tabindex, Left/Right switch the open
  menu), labeled `role="menu"` panels, `(picked)` with `{ menu, item }`.
- **`strct-tour`** — coach marks over live UI: CSS-selector targets get an
  accent spotlight ring + anchored dialog card (viewport-aware placement,
  `target: null` centers), Escape/skip vs. `finished` semantics.
- **`strct-watermark`** — pointer-transparent repeating diagonal text
  overlay for compliance consoles; XML-escaped, aria-hidden, content stays
  interactive.

Also: `strct-segmented` (already shipped) and `strct-metric-tile`'s
delta/trend covered the "content switcher" and "statistic" items of this
package — no duplicates added.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added — Datagrid Pro

The Clarity / MUI X-tier grid features, additively:

- **Per-column filters** — `columns[].filterable` opens a contains-text
  popover in the header; `columns[].filterOptions` renders a checkbox value
  set instead. Filters AND together, are two-way via `[(filters)]`
  (`StrctDatagridFilters`), reset paging, and in `lazy` mode ride on the
  `(lazyLoad)` state instead of filtering client-side.
- **Tree grid** — `childrenKey` renders hierarchical rows (the vCenter
  inventory shape): indentation + carets, per-sibling-level sorting,
  `role="treegrid"` with `aria-level` / `aria-expanded`; an active filter
  shows matches with their ancestors, force-expanded. Works with paging and
  virtual mode over the flattened visible set.
- **Inline cell editing** — `columns[].editable` opens an input on
  double-click; Enter / blur commit via `(cellEdit)` `{ row, column, value,
previous }`, Escape cancels, unchanged commits don't emit. The grid never
  mutates rows — the consumer's store stays the single source of truth.

### Fixed

- Tree rows announce correctly: `aria-expanded`/`aria-level` are emitted
  under a `treegrid` role, not on plain table rows (axe
  `aria-conditional-attr`).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added — the ops suite (monitoring-console trio + units)

Grafana / Blueprint-inspired components no general-purpose library ships
together, under a new **Ops** docs category:

- **`strct-time-range`** — the "Last 1 hour ▾" control charts hang off:
  Grafana-conventional quick ranges (15m…30d, customizable via `presets`)
  plus an absolute from/to editor, in one dialog popover (dogfoods
  `strct-dropdown`'s popover mode). Two-way `range`, `applied` output,
  `presetId` stamping and a `refresh()` method to re-resolve "last X"
  against now from your auto-refresh tick.
- **`strct-log-viewer`** — a virtualized log tail (`kubectl logs -f` as a
  component): only the visible window is in the DOM (5k lines ⇒ ~24 rows),
  two-way `follow` that sticks to the tail, pauses on scroll-up and resumes
  at the bottom, ANSI SGR colors (16-color + bold) parsed into safe spans
  mapped onto theme tokens, severity tinting from `StrctLogLine.level` or
  auto-detected ERROR/WARN tokens, and a wrap toggle. `role="log"`,
  keyboard-focusable scroll region.
- **`strct-diff`** — LCS line diff for change-approval screens: unified or
  side-by-side `split`, +/− symbol marking (never color alone), add/del
  counts, collapsible unchanged runs with expanders, copy-new-version
  button. `strctComputeDiff()` exported for programmatic "anything
  changed?" gating.
- **Unit formatting** — `strctFormatBytes` (binary KiB default / decimal
  opt-in), `strctFormatRate` (bit/s), `strctFormatDuration` ("2h 14m"),
  `strctFormatSi` ("12.4k IOPS") plus the matching `strctBytes` /
  `strctRate` / `strctDuration` / `strctSi` pipes.

### Fixed

- **`strct-dropdown` nested-interactive violation** (axe serious): the
  trigger wrapper was a `role="button"` around the consumer's real button.
  The wrapper is now inert; the new `StrctDropdownTrigger` directive
  (same `strctDropdownTrigger` attribute — import it to activate) carries
  `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` on the actual trigger element.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-21

App-integration gaps found by a consumer adopting 1.5.0 (FR-15), plus icon-set
hardening.

### Added

- **`strct-dropdown` popover mode** (FR-15-01) — `popover` turns the panel
  into a home for form controls: inner clicks / Enter / Space no longer close
  it (only outside click and Escape do), and semantics switch from
  `role="menu"` to a labeled `role="dialog"` (`popoverLabel`, default
  "Filters"). The trigger now exposes `aria-haspopup` (menu/dialog) +
  `aria-expanded` in both modes. Filter/settings panels no longer need to
  hand-roll `strctOverlay`.
- **`strct-command-palette` server-backed search** (FR-15-02) — `query` is
  now a two-way `model<string>` (still resets on open), and `[filter]="false"`
  opts out of internal ranking: items render in the order given, for
  RBAC-filtered / API-served corpora. `maxResults` still caps rendering, not
  selection. Bonus: `loading` + `loadingText` render a spinner "Searching…"
  row while results are in flight, and the active option is clamped when async
  results shrink under the cursor.
- **`strct-code` `wrap`** (FR-15-03) — soft-wraps long unbroken text
  (PEM/CSR blocks, base64 thumbprints, one-liner commands) via
  `white-space: pre-wrap; overflow-wrap: anywhere`, so dialogs never scroll
  horizontally. `wrap` takes precedence over `lineNumbers` (wrapping would
  break the gutter's line alignment).
- **`StrctIconName` union + `STRCT_ICON_NAMES`** — every built-in icon name
  as a compile-time union type and a greppable sorted array; `STRCT_ICON_GROUPS`
  is now typed against the union, and the `strct-icon` `name` input
  autocompletes built-ins while still accepting runtime-registered names.
- **`shieldCheck` glyph** — the "protection on" state (2FA enabled, verified),
  sharing the `shield` silhouette; icon set is now 180 glyphs.
- **Dev-mode unknown-icon warning** — `strct-icon` warns once per unknown
  name (an invented name used to fail silently as an empty box).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added — console patterns quartet

Four proven showcase/consumer patterns extracted into components:

- **`strct-copy`** — click-to-copy chip with ✓ "Copied" feedback (polite
  live-region announcement); for UUIDs, IPs, serials.
- **`strct-code`** — copyable mono code / rendered-config block: title +
  language tag + copy header, optional uncopyable line-number gutter,
  `maxHeight` scroll region, `collapsible` fold — the `<details><pre>`
  pattern, componentized.
- **`strct-page-header`** — breadcrumb slot + h1 title/subtitle + end-aligned
  actions + projected meta strip; the docs pages now run on it (dogfood).
- **`strct-filter-bar`** — `strct-searchbox` + removable filter chips +
  clear-all + live result count; presentation-only, intent via outputs.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added — `strct-searchbox`

The docs-header search pattern as a component: a compact pill with a leading
search icon, a label / input and an optional keyboard-hint chip.

- **Input mode** (default): a real search field — two-way `value` (CVA-
  compatible), Enter emits `(search)`, Escape / the labeled × clears, the
  hint chip hides while typing. `role="searchbox"`, fully labeled.
- **`trigger` mode**: a button that only emits `(activated)` — the classic
  "search pill that opens the command palette" header pattern; show the
  palette hotkey via `hint="⌘K"`.
- Public `focus()` / `clear()` methods; localizable labels.
- Dogfooded: the docs site's own header search now runs on it.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added — categorical chart palette `--chart-1..8` (FR-CHART-15)

- **Theme tokens** `--chart-1..8` in every palette × mode: a categorical data
  palette with a **fixed, colorblind-validated slot order per palette** (the
  CVD-safety mechanism). Slot 1 tracks the theme's accent hue at data-grade
  chroma, so a primary series feels on-theme without the muted UI `--acc`.
  Every set was run through the dataviz palette validator against its `--bg-0`
  surface — results and design rules in `docs/chart-palette.md`.
- **`StrctChartSeries.color`** — accepts a semantic status _or_ a categorical
  slot `'chart-1'..'chart-8'` (new `StrctChartColor` / `StrctChartSlot`
  types). Semantic statuses stay reserved for health; existing callers are
  untouched.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed — `strct-chart` tooltip edge clamp (FR-CHART-14)

The hover tooltip now **edge-flips** instead of centering blindly: near the
left edge it left-aligns, near the right edge it right-aligns (single, multi
and gap tips alike), so the **first and last point's values are never
clipped** by an `overflow: hidden` ancestor (cards, scroll panes). The
crosshair stays on the true point-X — only the balloon shifts; mid-chart
hovers are unchanged. The y-axis value chip is likewise clamped into the
plot box.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added — `strct-chart` advanced axes & composition (all additive)

- **`stacked`** — multi-series values stack cumulatively: each series draws
  at the running total and fills a solid layer band down to the series below;
  tooltips keep the original per-series values; nulls break the stack.
- **`times`** — per-point timestamps (`number | Date`): x positions map to
  real time, so uneven sampling renders honestly; hover snaps to the nearest
  point by pixel distance; labels/annotations/zoom all follow.
- **`scale="log"`** — logarithmic y-axis with equal decade spacing and decade
  ticks; the floor is the smallest positive visible value (or an explicit
  positive `min`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added — `strct-datagrid` power features (all additive)

- **Column drag-reorder** — `reorderable`: drag headers to rearrange data
  columns; the order persists through `columnState` / `stateKey` (new
  `order` field on `StrctDatagridColumnState`).
- **Row grouping** — `groupBy`: a collapsible header row per distinct value
  with a count chip; the current sort applies within groups. Paging is
  bypassed while grouped; not combinable with `virtual`.
- **Excel export** — `toXLSX()` / `downloadXLSX(filename)`: a real `.xlsx`
  workbook built with an in-house, **dependency-free** SpreadsheetML + ZIP
  writer (stored entries, correct CRC32). Numeric cells stay numeric; opens
  in Excel, LibreOffice and Google Sheets.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-17

**UIStruct is stable.** Every 1.0 criterion in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) is
met: RTL/i18n audit (with fixes), strict APG datepicker grid, a visual
regression gate in CI, a full API review (327 signal members — the surface
freezes as-is, taxonomy in [docs/api-review.md](docs/api-review.md)), and
published reproducible benchmarks. From here on the
[semver contract](ROADMAP.md#after-10--semver-contract) applies: patches fix,
minors add, majors migrate — deprecations live for at least one minor first.

### Infrastructure — visual regression gate

- New `visual-regression` CI job: `scripts/visual-regression.mjs` screenshots
  key routes (dark + light) in headless Chrome and compares them against
  committed baselines (`tests/visual/baseline/`), failing on >0.5% pixel
  drift; diff images upload as artifacts. Animations/transitions are frozen
  and the showcase now **self-hosts DM Sans / JetBrains Mono** (fontsource),
  making rendering deterministic across machines — and giving every visitor
  the intended typography instead of a system-font fallback.

### Changed — 1.0 hardening

- **`strct-datagrid` sticky columns are RTL-correct** — frozen-column offsets
  use logical `inset-inline-start`, so they pin to the reading start under
  `dir="rtl"`; the edge shadow mirrors.
- **`strct-datepicker` implements the strict APG date-grid pattern** — real
  ARIA grid semantics (`grid` / `row` / `columnheader` / labeled `gridcell`s),
  roving focus on the day cells, `Home`/`End` (week edges),
  `Shift+PageUp/PageDown` (year), `aria-selected` / `aria-current="date"`,
  and focus returns to the input on close.

## [0.31.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed — RTL audit outcomes

Full `dir="rtl"` audit (static sweep + rendered verification — see
`docs/rtl-audit.md`). Text/spacing/borders were already fully logical; these
directional behaviors are now correct in RTL too:

- **`strct-toggle`** — the thumb travels toward inline-end
  (`:host-context([dir='rtl'])` — the component uses emulated encapsulation).
- **`strct-drawer`** — `start`/`end` anchor with logical insets; the slide-in
  animation mirrors.
- **`strct-nav`** — the mobile off-canvas panel anchors inline-start and
  slides from the correct edge.
- **Icon badges & rail dots** — anchored with `inset-inline-end`.
- **Datagrid** — column-resize grip and chooser alignment use logical insets.

Known caveat (tracked in ROADMAP): datagrid sticky-column offsets remain
physical-left; keep wide frozen grids in an LTR container for now.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added — `strct-datagrid` enterprise pack (all additive)

- **Virtual scrolling** — `virtual` + `viewportHeight` + `rowHeight`: only the
  viewport rows (plus a small overscan) are in the DOM, with a sticky header —
  20k+ rows scroll smoothly. Assumes uniform row height; not combinable with
  `expandable`.
- **Server-side data** — `lazy` + `total` + `(lazyLoad)`: the grid never sorts
  or slices `rows` itself; it emits `{ page, pageSize, sortKey, sortDir }` on
  init and whenever the user pages or sorts, and shows rows as given. `total`
  drives the pager and footer count.
- **Sticky (frozen) columns** — `StrctDatagridColumn.sticky` pins leading
  columns (utility columns freeze automatically alongside) with exact
  cumulative offsets, opaque grounds and an edge shadow on the last frozen
  column. Give sticky columns an explicit px `width`.
- **Column state persistence** — two-way `columnState` (widths from resize +
  hidden from the chooser) and `stateKey` for built-in localStorage
  persistence (`strct-dg:<key>`), restored before first render.
- **CSV export** — public `toCSV()` / `downloadCSV(filename)` with proper
  quoting: header labels + every non-hidden column, all rows in the current
  order (full sorted set in client mode, as-given in lazy mode).

## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added — navigation gaps (FR-NAV-01 / FR-NAV-02, all additive)

**`strct-rail`** (`StrctRailItem`):

- **`placement: 'bottom'`** — pins an item to the foot of the rail under a
  divider (vCenter-style Administration), in declaration order. The top group
  scrolls; the bottom group stays put.
- **`routerLink` / `href`** — the item renders as a real `<a>`: middle-click,
  ⌘/Ctrl-click and "open in new tab" work like a real link; `(select)` still
  fires on plain activation, and modified clicks never touch `activeId`. With
  `routerLink`, the router's own active state drives highlighting when no
  explicit `activeId` is provided (explicit wins).
- **`dot` + `dotStatus`, `trailingIcon`** — the same trailing vocabulary as the
  section menu (below), so the two nav objects stay consistent.

**`strct-section-menu`** (`StrctMenuLink`):

- **`badge` + `badgeStatus`** — trailing count/label chip (e.g. deviations).
- **`dot` + `dotStatus`** — small trailing status dot ("unsaved changes").
- **`trailingIcon`** — muted trailing glyph ("restart required"), rendered
  after the label and before any badge / dot.

Both share the `StrctRailStatus` tone union — no new status vocabulary. Items
without the new fields render identically to 0.29.0.

### Changed

- `@angular/router` is now a peer dependency (used by `strct-rail` link items).

## [0.29.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added — `strct-chart` monitoring suite (FR-CHART-08..13, all additive)

- **Data gaps** — `data` / `series.data` accept `(number | null)[]`; a `null`
  (or `NaN`) breaks the line into disjoint segments, so an outage never reads
  as a flat line. The gap keeps its x-slot; hovering it says `gapText`
  ("no data"); area fills drop to the baseline at gap edges.
- **Synced crosshairs** — new `(hoverIndex)` output + `[activeIndex]` input:
  wire one chart's hover into a sibling's crosshair for a vCenter-style
  multi-chart dashboard. A local pointer always wins.
- **Annotations** — `annotations: { index; label?; status?; dashed? }[]` draws
  vertical event markers ("alarm raised", "reboot") behind the data; the label
  joins the tooltip at that index.
- **Min–max band** — per-series `lower` / `upper` bounds fill a soft envelope
  behind the avg line, so downsampled spikes stay visible; the tooltip shows
  `avg (min–max)`.
- **Brush + zoom** — `brush` drag-selects a range and emits
  `(brushChange) [start, end]`; `zoom` **zooms the chart into the selection**
  (y rescales to the visible window) with a ⟲ reset chip — double-click or
  Escape zooms back out, emitting `null`.
- **Export** — public `toSVG()` / `toPNG(scale)` methods return the rendered
  chart with theme colors resolved, background and axis text baked in.

All defaults reproduce the previous behavior exactly; keyboard access extends
to the new surface (Escape unwinds brush → zoom → crosshair).

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added — `running` icon badge (vCenter lifecycle language)

Lifecycle states now speak vCenter's media-transport language, as glyphs
inside the badge disc: **green disc ▶ `running`** (new) · **amber disc ⏸
`paused`** · **grey disc ■ `off`**. Health states keep their silhouette
coding (circle ✓ / triangle ! / diamond × / circle i / wrench). `success`
now reads as _healthy_; use `running` for power state.

### Changed

- `paused` badge: grey → amber disc (lifecycle family).
- `off` badge: square – → neutral grey disc with a stop square ■.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed — icon badges: silhouette coding (CVD-safe at any size)

Badge states now differ by **outline silhouette**, not just hue + inner glyph,
so they stay distinguishable for color-blind users even at 16px where the
inner glyph is too small to read: circle ✓ success · triangle ! warning ·
**diamond × critical** (new shape) · **square – off** (new shape) ·
circle i info · wrench maintenance.

### Added — `paused` icon badge

New `StrctIconBadge` value for lifecycle states: a circle with two pause
bars (⏸), distinct from `off` — a paused VM no longer has to render as
powered-off.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed — `strct-datagrid` enclosed chrome

The action bar, grid and footer now share **one enclosing frame** (border +
radius + shadow on the host), separated by interior hairlines — the whole
component reads as a single object on the page instead of three floating
pieces. The table rounds only the frame corners it actually touches (no
toolbar above / no footer below). No API change.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added — `strct-modal` draggable + styling hooks

- **`draggable`** — reposition the dialog by dragging its header (Pointer
  Events: mouse + touch). Clamped to the viewport, never starts from the close
  button or header controls, re-centers on every open. Keyboard/AT flows
  unchanged.
- **`panelClass` / `backdropClass`** — append custom class(es) to the dialog
  panel / backdrop, so consumers style modals from app-global CSS instead of
  piercing internal class names with `::ng-deep`.
- **`variant="glass"`** — built-in theme-aware frosted preset (translucent
  panel + blurred, tinted backdrop).

### Added — `strct-datagrid` single-line rows

- **`singleLine`** — keep every row exactly one line tall: cell content never
  wraps, long values truncate with an ellipsis (detail rows exempt), so tall
  content can't distort the grid.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added — `strct-tree` density

- **`density`** input on `strct-tree` (`'compact' | 'comfortable'`, default
  `compact`). `comfortable` relaxes rows to 14px text / 18px icons with taller
  rows and wider indent — for touch-friendly or low-density consoles. The
  compact default renders pixel-identical to before.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-14

### Changed — `strct-card` grows rich, opt-in states

All backward-compatible; a plain composed card renders exactly as before.

- **`status`** — tone rail on the leading edge (same language as alert / hero).
- **`interactive`** — hover lift + accent border for clickable cards.
- **`selected`** — accent ring for card-picker layouts.
- **`dense`** — tighter paddings across header / block / footer.
- **`loading`** — indeterminate top bar + `aria-busy`; body and footer dim and
  ignore input. Reduced-motion collapses the bar to a static strip.
- **`collapsible` + two-way `collapsed`** — the header grows a labeled chevron
  toggle (`aria-expanded`); block and footer hide while collapsed.
- **`strct-card-header`** gains an `icon` input and localizable
  `collapseLabel` / `expandLabel`.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added — `strct-command-palette` + `strct-kbd`

- **`strct-command-palette`** — a ⌘/Ctrl-K spotlight over app commands or pages.
  `items` (`{ id; label; group?; icon?; hint?; keywords?; data? }[]`), two-way
  `open`, built-in `hotkey`, ranked filtering (label prefix > word start >
  substring > keywords), `(picked)` output. ARIA combobox/listbox pattern with
  `aria-activedescendant`, full keyboard support, focus restore on close,
  reduced-motion safe, localizable strings. The docs site's own ⌘K now runs on
  it (dogfooded — and the wrapper shrank from 287 to ~60 lines).
- **`strct-kbd`** — inline keyboard-key chip for shortcut hints.

### Changed — overlay a11y audit outcomes

- Audit result: `strct-combobox`, `strct-context-menu` and `strct-cascade-select`
  already follow their APG patterns (combobox/listbox, menu/menuitem) — no
  changes needed. `strct-datepicker` uses a labeled dialog with button day cells
  and arrow-key focus; a strict APG grid refinement is noted for later.
- **`strct-tree`** — chevron toggles now have a 24×24px hit target
  (WCAG 2.5.8) without changing visual density, and their rotation honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## [0.21.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed — axe-core smoke findings

The new CI a11y gate (axe-core over eight key routes) caught and we fixed:

- **`strct-tree`** — expand/collapse chevrons were unnamed `role="button"`
  elements; they now expose "Expand/Collapse <label>".
- **`strct-progress`** — bars had no accessible name; new `label` input
  (falls back to "Progress").
- **`strct-table` / `strct-datagrid`** — horizontal scroll containers are now
  keyboard-focusable named regions (WCAG scrollable-region-focusable).

### Infrastructure

- **vitest 3 → 4** — resolves the `@angular/build` peer conflict; the lockfile is
  back in sync and `npm ci` works without `--legacy-peer-deps` (CI updated).
- **CI is green again** — fixed the stale showcase footer assertion that had
  failed every run since June 12.
- **New `a11y-smoke` CI job** — axe-core over key routes (fails on
  serious/critical) + per-page screenshots uploaded as artifacts.
- **New `Publish to npm` workflow** — pushing a `v*` tag builds, tests and
  publishes `@akcelik/strct` with provenance (requires the `NPM_TOKEN` secret).
  npm's latest was stuck at 0.11.0.
- **README** — real screenshots (dashboard, theming) and up-to-date counts.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-07-19

### Changed — "16 Native" icon render policy

- **Object / semantic glyphs now render at the grid's native 16px** instead of
  13–15px (a fractional downscale that blurred hairlines). 16 call sites updated
  across alert, toast, tree, datagrid (settings/refresh), context menu, section
  menu, field/validation adornments, segmented, metric-tile, datepicker,
  password and theme-switcher. Simple single-stroke glyphs (chevrons, close,
  check, dots, sort arrows) stay at 11–14px by design — the policy is documented
  in the icon source. This matches the 16px-grid convention of Octicons, Carbon,
  Fluent and Clarity.

### Fixed

- **`ellipsis` icon added** — `strct-pagination`'s gap indicator referenced an
  unregistered name and silently rendered nothing; the "…" between page numbers
  is now visible.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-19

### Icons — coverage, variants & small-size legibility (142 → 178 glyphs)

- **Added — time & communication:** `clock`, `history`, `timer`, `hourglass`,
  `mail`, `chat` (an NTP settings page finally has its clock).
- **Added — general UI:** `help`, `home`, `link`, `globe`, `star`, `pin`, `share`,
  `archive`, `zoomIn`/`zoomOut`, `fullscreen`/`exitFullscreen`, `listView`,
  `dragHandle`.
- **Added — direction set completed:** `chevronUp` (was missing!) and
  `chevronDoubleLeft/Up/Down`.
- **Added — infrastructure & identity:** `dns`, `vpn`, `api`, `bolt`, `queue`,
  `users`, `login`, `unlock`, `ban`.
- **Added — off-state composites & aliases:** `wifiOff`, `cloudOff`, `linkOff`
  (slash composites); `unlink` → `linkOff`, `webhook` → `bolt`.
- **Legibility repairs (verified at 14px, the real usage size):** 13 dense glyphs
  redrawn so parallel details keep ≥ 1.5px gaps on the 16-grid — `nic` and `hba`
  are now clearly distinct (one large square port vs two round ports), and
  `memory`, `ethernet`, `switch`, `portGroup`, `keyboard`, `motherboard`, `psu`,
  `gpu`, `sdCard`, `usb` no longer smudge; `braille` dots enlarged. The tree
  chevron stroke is standardized to the 1.3–1.5 guideline, and a **detail-budget
  rule** is documented in the icon source.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-19

### Accessibility & design-system hardening

A tri-lens audit (visual arts · HCI · vision science) of the whole library,
implemented end to end. All changes are backward-compatible; deprecations noted.

#### Fixed — contrast (WCAG AA, computed)

- **Light-mode semantic tones darkened** across all three palettes so colored
  _text_ meets AA ≥ 4.5:1 (previously: warning ≈ 3.4:1, success ≈ 3.9:1,
  accent ≈ 4.1:1). Matching translucent tints updated. Dark mode unchanged.
- **Text on solid status fills** now uses the new rule `color: var(--inv)` instead
  of hard-coded `#fff` (solid badges, hero chips, solid buttons, checkbox check,
  datepicker selected day, speed-dial, toggle thumb). Previously _every_ dark-mode
  solid badge failed AA (2.2–3.5:1); now ≥ 5:1 in both modes. No hard-coded colors
  remain in the library; header-anchored UI uses the new `--hdr-fg` token.
- **`strct-badge`**: the misspelled public class `strct-badge--warninging` is fixed
  to `strct-badge--warning`; the old class is still emitted as a deprecated alias.

#### Fixed — motion & typography

- `prefers-reduced-motion` now also disables the modal, drawer and toast entrance
  animations; charts track the OS setting _live_ instead of reading it once.
- **12px type floor restored**: chart axis/tooltip annotations, flow role tags,
  datepicker weekday header, section-menu category labels and metric-tile deltas
  (10–11.5px) are all ≥ 12px. Display sizes are tokenized: new `--text-2xl` (22px)
  and `--text-3xl` (26px) used by gauge, donut and metric-tile.

#### Added — keyboard & screen-reader access

- **`strct-tree`** implements the ARIA tree pattern: roving tabindex (one tab stop
  per tree instead of one per row), ArrowUp/Down/Left/Right + Home/End navigation,
  `aria-level`, and a visible `:focus-visible` ring on rows.
- **`strct-chart`** is now exposed to AT: `role="img"` with a generated data
  summary, keyboard-focusable crosshair (arrows / Home / End / Escape) and an
  `aria-live` announcement of the selected point. X-axis labels are positioned at
  their datapoint's real x (an honest axis under `xTicks` subsampling); overlays
  are anchored to the plot so the legend can't shift them.
- **`strct-donut`**: `role="img"` summary naming every slice; legend rows are
  keyboard-focusable and drive the center readout.
- **`strct-modal`**: the backdrop is no longer an unnamed `role="button"` phantom
  tab stop (keyboard dismissal is Escape, unchanged).

#### Added — color-vision safety

- Icon status badges are **shape-coded**: ✓ success · × critical · i info · – off
  (warning already had its ! triangle), so object state never relies on hue alone.
- **`strct-chart` series** accept `dash` (boolean or dasharray) as a second visual
  channel; the legend swatch mirrors the pattern.
- The donut fallback palette's translucent 5th color is replaced with an opaque
  accent mix.

#### Added — internationalization & RTL

- Every user-visible / assistive string is now an input: `strct-datagrid`
  `[labels]` (row/rows/selected + all aria labels), `strct-alert` `dismissLabel`,
  `strct-modal` `closeLabel`, `strct-spinner` `label`, toast outlet `regionLabel`,
  pagination `prevLabel/nextLabel/regionLabel`, wizard `backLabel/nextLabel`,
  chart `agoFormat`.
- Library styles converted to **CSS logical properties**
  (margin/padding/border-inline, text-align start/end) for RTL-readiness.

#### Added — API consistency

- **`strct-tabs`** `selectedIndex` and **`strct-wizard`** `current` are now
  two-way `model()`s, completing the controlled-state pattern alongside the tree's
  `expandedIds` and the datagrid's `initialSelection`.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **`strct-datagrid`** — `initialSelection` input seeds the checked rows (values are
  row ids matching `rowId`; requires `selectable`). Assigning a new array re-seeds —
  e.g. open a picker dialog with the current members already checked — while the
  user's later toggles are preserved until it changes. Additive; defaults to `null`
  (no selection), so existing grids are unchanged.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added — `strct-tree` stable identity + observable / controlled expansion

All additive and backward-compatible:

- **Stable node identity** — `StrctTreeNodeData.id` gives each node a stable key,
  used for `trackBy`, expansion state and a `data-node-id` DOM attribute. Falls back
  to `label` when absent.
- **Observable expansion** — `(expandedChange)` emits the full set of expanded ids on
  every toggle; `(nodeToggled)` emits `{ node, expanded }` per toggle.
- **Controlled expansion** — `[(expandedIds)]` (two-way) makes the parent the single
  source of truth, so persisting/restoring which nodes are open is a one-liner. When
  null (default), expansion stays uncontrolled, seeded from each node's `expanded`
  flag exactly as before.

With no `id`, no `expandedIds` and no listeners, the tree behaves exactly as today.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **`strct-modal`** — a **dismissible** modal no longer closes when you press
  **Space** (or Enter) while typing in a field inside it. The keyboard-close
  handlers on the backdrop now ignore events that bubbled up from a child, and only
  act on a real backdrop click or Enter/Space while the backdrop itself is focused.
  No API change.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **`file`** — a plain document glyph (a file with a dog-ear fold, no field / text
  lines) for file-browser and file-list UIs, distinct from `template` (lined) and
  `form` (form fields).
- **`clipboard`** — a clipboard with a checklist, for "task list" semantics
  (distinct from `logs`, which reads as a stream). Icon count: 142.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added — `strct-chart` gaps (all additive, back-compatible)

- **Multi-series** — new `series` input (`{ data; label?; status?; area?; curve? }[]`)
  draws several colored lines that share the x/y domain, with a per-series hover
  tooltip. Falls back to `data` when unset. Shorter series are right-aligned.
- **Legend** — `legend` renders a swatch + label per labeled series.
- **Persistent y-axis** — `yAxis` (+ `yTicks`, `axisFormat`) shows value labels
  aligned to the gridlines; a left gutter is reserved so the plot never overlaps.
- **Thresholds** — `thresholds` (`{ value; label?; status?; dashed? }[]`) draws
  horizontal reference lines (dashed by default) with an optional right-edge tag.
- **Y-axis floor** — `min` pins the baseline (defaults to 0, i.e. today's behavior).
- **Empty state** — `emptyText` (default "No data") renders a centered message at
  the normal height when there are no points, instead of an empty SVG.
- **X-axis tick control** — `xTicks` subsamples labels to ~N evenly spaced ticks and
  `xFormat` reformats them.

Every new input defaults to today's behavior, so existing single-series usage is
unchanged.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added — 27 new icons

The datacenter icon set grows from 113 to 140 glyphs, in four new gallery groups:

- **Storage & media** — `opticalDisc` (CD/DVD), `ssd`, `usb`, `sdCard`, `tape`.
- **Hardware** — `gpu`, `psu`, `fan`, `battery`, `ups`, `motherboard`, `sensor`,
  `thermometer`.
- **AI** — `sparkles`, `brain`, `robot`, `neuralNetwork`, `aiChip`, `wand`, `model`.
- **Peripherals & network** — `router`, `loadBalancer`, `wifi`, `bluetooth`,
  `monitor`, `keyboard`, `printer`.

All are stroke glyphs on the shared 16×16 grid, so size, color and status badges
work as for every other icon.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **`strct-donut`** — removed the glow on the hovered slice; the focus effect is now
  just the slice growing while the others dim (cleaner, flatter).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-25

### Changed — `strct-donut` is now interactive

- **Hover to focus** — hovering a slice (or its legend row) highlights it (it grows)
  while the others dim, and the center reads out that slice's value, label and
  share. `interactive` (default on) toggles this.
- **Legend** — new `legend` input renders a `color · label · value · %` list beside
  the ring, hover-linked to the slices in both directions.
- **Modern slices** — rounded caps with gaps between slices (new `gap`, in degrees)
  and a sweep-in entrance animation (honours `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- Back-compatible: existing `segments` / `size` / `thickness` / `centerValue` /
  `centerLabel` usage is unchanged.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-25

### Changed — `strct-chart` line chart overhaul

A ground-up rework of the line / area chart for trends and live telemetry:

- **Smooth curves** — lines now use monotone-cubic interpolation by default
  (curves that never overshoot the data). New `curve` input: `'smooth' | 'linear' |
'step'`.
- **Area toggle** — `area` is now an independent boolean (a soft vertical
  gradient), separate from `type`. `type="area"` still works.
- **Live streaming** — `live` scrolls the window left as new points arrive (a
  conveyor slide), with a pulsing head at the leading edge and a one-time draw-on.
  `interval` drives the scroll duration.
- **Ambient glow** — `glow` adds a layered neon glow to the line and head dot.
- **Hover crosshair + tooltip** — `interactive` (default on) shows a vertical +
  horizontal crosshair, a value chip on the y-axis edge, the highlighted x label,
  and a tooltip with the value, the ▲/▼ delta from the previous point, and the time
  (`Xs ago` while live).
- **Crisp at any size** — the SVG is now measured (1:1 coordinates via
  `ResizeObserver`) instead of stretched, so dots, the head and the glow stay
  perfectly round and sharp.
- New `strokeWidth`, `grid` and `dots` inputs. All animations honour
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **`strct-hero`** — a page-level status summary banner: a tone-colored surface with
  a leading icon chip, a heading, a description and optional right-aligned metadata
  (`[strctHeroMeta]`) / actions (`[strctHeroActions]`). `role="status"` (or `alert`
  when `status="critical"`), with the heading as the accessible name.
- **`strct-flow`** — an animated relationship between two (or N) endpoints: packets
  travel along the connector when `live`, with `direction` (`forward` / `reverse` /
  `both`) and horizontal / vertical orientation. Degrades to a static gradient +
  arrow when idle or under `prefers-reduced-motion`; `role="img"` with a summary
  label.
- **`strct-description-list` + `strct-desc`** — a compact `label → value` definition
  list, driven by an `items` input or projected `<strct-desc>` rows (so a value can
  host a badge or icon). Stacked rows plus an `inline` stat-strip variant.
- **`strct-segmented`** — a single-select segmented control with managed selected
  state, `ControlValueAccessor`-compatible. `role="radiogroup"` with roving tabindex
  and arrow-key navigation; `sm` / `md` sizes and a `block` width.
- **`strct-cell-status`** — a small "checking → ok / warning / error (reason)"
  affordance (spinner / icon + message, `aria-live`) for datagrid cells.
- Shared **`StrctStatus`** and **`StrctThresholds`** types in the public API.

  Component count: 63.

### Changed

- **`strct-progress` / `strct-gauge`** gained an optional `thresholds` input
  (`{ warning?, critical? }`). When set, the meter derives its own status from the
  value (≥ critical → critical, ≥ warning → warning, else the healthy base), so
  callers stop computing status for every disk / memory meter. Back-compatible: an
  explicit `status` still wins when no thresholds are given.
- **`strct-field`** gained a `validationState` input
  (`{ status: 'idle' | 'checking' | 'ok' | 'warning' | 'error'; message? }`),
  rendered as a trailing spinner / check / warning adornment plus the message in the
  hint / error slot (`aria-live`). An explicit `error` still takes precedence.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`strct-section-menu`** — a two-level navigation menu (categories → items; not a
  tree). Categories are `collapsible` with chevrons (default) or render as static
  uppercase section labels; category / item icons can be hidden with `showIcons`;
  the active item gets a soft accent tint. Two-way `activeId`, `select` output.
  Standalone, token-themed. Component count: 59.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Reworked the modal size scale.** The old `sm` (380px) sat too close to `md`, so
  the two are merged: `sm` is now **480px** and the rest shift up one step —
  **md 640 · lg 860** — with a new, larger **xl 1080**. The default stays `sm`
  (480px = the previous default width), so untouched modals look the same; explicit
  `size="md" | "lg" | "xl"` now render one step wider.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-09

### Changed — behavior

- **Modals no longer close on a backdrop click or the Escape key by default.** A
  modal now closes only through its X button or an explicit action button, so a
  stray click outside (or an accidental Escape) can't discard in-progress work.
  The `dismissible` input (default now `false`) opts a modal back into backdrop /
  Escape dismissal for lightweight, transient dialogs.

  **Migration:** if you relied on click-outside / Escape to close a modal, add the
  `dismissible` attribute to that `<strct-modal>`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Modal sizes are now a fixed 4-step scale.** `size` accepts `'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'`
  with set widths — **sm 380 · md 480 · lg 640 · xl 860 px** — so dialogs stay
  consistent (no arbitrary widths). Adds `xl` and rounds the existing presets
  (was sm 360 / md 460 / lg 720). Backward compatible; `sm`/`md`/`lg` still valid.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Tree rows are more compact.** Reduced tree-node row vertical padding (7px → 4px)
  and gap (7px → 6px), bringing row height from ~34px to ~28px for a denser
  navigation list. Legibility and click target preserved. Visual only; no API change.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added — new components (development round, phase 1 of 5)

- **`strct-metric-tile`** — a dense KPI tile for dashboards: a label, a large value
  (+ unit), an optional change indicator (`delta` — its sign drives the arrow and
  colour; `invertDelta` for metrics where up is bad) and an inline sparkline.
- **`strct-empty-state`** — a centered zero / permission / error state with preset
  `variant`s (`empty` / `denied` / `error` / `notfound`), an icon, a title, an
  optional description and a projected call-to-action slot.

Component count: 58. Both are standalone, token-themed and backward compatible.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Accordion is now a unified stack.** Panels were previously detached cards
  separated by gaps; they now form one cohesive surface — a single rounded border
  with hairline dividers between consecutive panels and no gaps. Independent
  expand/collapse behaviour is unchanged. Visual only; no API change.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added — Visual comfort & accessibility (eye-health round II)

Continuing the eye-strain work from 0.7.2, this round respects the user's
environment and their operating-system accessibility settings. Why each change:

- **OS-aware theming.** `StrctThemeService` now follows the operating system's
  `prefers-color-scheme` when the user has not made an explicit choice, and keeps
  following it live. An explicit selection still wins and is persisted. Reason: a
  user working at night or in a dim room should not be forced onto a bright screen
  on first load (high luminance + melanopic / blue-light load suppresses melatonin
  and shifts circadian phase). The showcase resolves the same preference before
  paint to avoid a flash.
- **High-contrast support (`prefers-contrast: more`).** When the OS asks for more
  contrast (low-vision users, bright ambient light), borders and secondary /
  tertiary text are strengthened and the focus ring becomes a solid 3px accent
  outline. It is active **only** when the OS requests it — the default look is
  unchanged.

### Changed

- **Type-size floor raised to 12px.** Every piece of readable text that previously
  sat at 11px (hints, captions, labels and metadata across components) is now
  ≥ 12px, and the default body line-height is 1.5. Reason: 11px sustained reading
  is below the comfortable acuity threshold for all-day console work; together
  with the 0.7.2 contrast fix this removes the remaining small-text strain. No
  layout regressions.

Backward compatible — no API or token-name changes. (`prefers-reduced-motion`
continues to be honoured by the base stylesheet.)

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-08

### Changed — Visual comfort & eye health

These token tweaks come from a vision-science / WCAG review of the theme, aimed at
**reducing eye strain during long, all-day operations-console sessions**. Why each
change was made:

- **Tertiary text (`--t3`) now meets WCAG AA (≥ 4.5:1) in all six schemes.** It
  previously measured only ~2.4:1 (dark) and ~3.0:1 (light) — below the AA
  threshold — yet it is used for hints, captions, placeholders and metadata. Text
  that faint forces the eye into sustained accommodation to decode it, and on dark
  backgrounds off-axis halation lowers the effective contrast even further. `--t3`
  now measures **4.65–4.77:1** everywhere.
- **Secondary text (`--t2`) raised in the ember & sage palettes (to ~6:1).** Two
  reasons: (1) raising `--t3` would otherwise have inverted the text hierarchy, so
  `--t2` had to stay above it (the intended order is `--t1` > `--t2` > `--t3`); and
  (2) `--t2` itself was already slightly below AA (~4.2–4.4:1) in the ember/sage
  light schemes.
- **Light arctic surface (`--bg-1`) softened from pure `#ffffff` to `#fbfcfd`.**
  A pure-white surface produces discomfort glare (high luminance + high melanopic /
  blue-light load) in dim datacenter rooms and creates a harsh near-black-on-white
  contrast that triggers halation. A ~5% off-white reduces both while staying well
  within AA.

Values only — **no API or token-name changes, fully backward compatible.** The
`--t1` > `--t2` > `--t3` legibility hierarchy is preserved across every palette and
mode. (`prefers-reduced-motion` was already honoured in the base stylesheet.)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Trash icon** — redesigned the `trash` glyph as a clearer waste-bin (lid bar + handle + tapered rounded body + three vertical ridges) so it reads unmistakably as delete at small sizes.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`strct-rail`** — collapsible, data-driven primary navigation rail for an application shell. Items are icon + label + optional status badge (`StrctRailItem`); collapsing shrinks it to an icon-only rail where badges become dots and labels become tooltips. Two-way `activeId` / `collapsed`, `select` output.
- **`strct-drawer`** — edge-anchored slide-out overlay panel (`side` = start/end/top/bottom, `size` = sm/md/lg) for inspector / edit flows without losing the underlying list's scroll or selection. Two-way `open`, backdrop + Escape dismiss, `strctDrawerFooter` slot.

### Notes

- These were identified as the highest-value gaps for infrastructure consoles (alongside the existing shell, vertical-nav and stack/property views). Component count: 56.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Datagrid row actions** — set `[rowActions]="(row) => StrctMenuItem[]"` to give every row a trailing actions column with a vertical-dots (kebab) button that opens that row's data-driven, body-portaled menu. A new `(rowAction)` output emits `{ row, item }` on selection.
- **`StrctMenuService`** — imperatively open the data-driven menu panel at viewport coordinates; shared by the `[strctContextMenu]` directive and the datagrid kebab.

### Changed

- The `[strctContextMenu]` directive now delegates to `StrctMenuService` (no behavioral change).

## [0.5.31] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

- **Switch icon** — redesigned the `switch` glyph as a network switch front-panel view (chassis + two status LEDs + a row of RJ45 ports) instead of the previous box-with-legs shape that read as an insect.

## [0.5.27] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Maintenance badge icon** — refined the badge SVG to closer match the classic hand-holding-wrench silhouette (open wrench head + fingers gripping the handle).

## [0.5.26] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Maintenance badge icon** — refined the badge SVG to read as a hand holding a wrench for a more universal "under maintenance" meaning.
- **Maintenance badge size** — slightly enlarged so the hand+wrench detail is readable at small icon sizes.

## [0.5.25] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Maintenance badge icon** — replaced the single-wrench SVG with a crossed wrench + screwdriver glyph to match classic maintenance/tooling iconography.
- **Icon badges** — all status badges (success, critical, off, info, warning, maintenance) are now slightly larger and positioned a bit further outside the glyph for better visibility.
- **Showcase footer version** — footer version is now bound to `App.version` so it stays in sync with releases.

## [0.5.24] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Icon maintenance badge** — new `badge="maintenance"` overlay renders a small wrench icon on a yellow badge, perfect for host/cluster/vm maintenance states.
- **Showcase icons page** — added `Maintenance` to the interactive state buttons and updated static state examples to use the new maintenance badge.

## [0.5.23] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Icon warning badge** — enlarged the warning triangle badge (up to 14px) and added a black exclamation mark inside it so degraded states are much more readable at a glance.

## [0.5.22] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Showcase icons page** — new "Interactive object states" demo where you can click state buttons (Running / Maint / Critical / Stopped) to update the badge on Cluster, Host and VM icons in real time.
- **Object states gallery** — expanded the static state grid to cover every state for Cluster, Host and VM.

## [0.5.21] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Icon badges** — the `warning` badge overlay is now a yellow triangle instead of a solid circle, making degraded/warning states more recognizable at a glance.
- **Showcase icons page** — added a "Cluster · degraded" state example so the new warning triangle badge is demonstrated on the cluster icon.

## [0.5.20] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Icon set** — redesigned the `cluster` glyph as a group of three vertical server/rack units (center unit prominent, side units behind) with small indicator dots, inspired by classic datacenter cluster iconography.

## [0.5.19] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Icon set** — redesigned the `cluster` glyph as a clearer 2×2 grid of connected nodes so it reads as a cluster/group at small sizes.

## [0.5.18] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Showcase icons page** — vendor marks in the Vendors demo are now rendered as uppercase text labels (HPE, DELL, CISCO, VMWARE, KAYTUS) instead of abstract SVG glyphs.
- **Showcase data page** — Table and Datagrid demos now display cluster rows (`Cluster / Type / Hosts / Status`) instead of generic service rows, matching the datacenter theme.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Datagrid column chooser** — moved back to the left side of the footer, keeping the `strct-button` neutral small style.

### Fixed

- **Showcase app** — restored the component library documentation structure (landing page, component browser, sidebar categories) that was accidentally replaced by an appliance management app.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Datagrid column chooser placement** — the column visibility toggle has moved from the left side of the footer to the far right, next to pagination.
- **Datagrid column chooser button style** — the settings button now uses the standard `strct-button` component with `size="sm"` and `variant="neutral"` instead of a custom styled icon button.
- **Datagrid dropdown alignment** — the column chooser dropdown menu is now right-aligned so it no longer overflows the grid boundary.

### Added

- **Datagrid docs** — added missing API entries for `columnChooser`, `resizable` and `loading` inputs in the showcase registry.
- **Datagrid test** — added a unit test covering column chooser open/close and column visibility toggling.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-05

Major framework-quality release. Consolidates semantics, expands the icon set, introduces a scalable token system, loading states, responsive behaviours and accessibility improvements.

### Added

- **Expanded icon set** — 17 foundational action icons (`plus`, `minus`, `pencil`, `trash`, `refresh`, `filter`, `settings`, `user`, `logout`, `undo`, `redo`, `arrowUp`, `arrowDown`, `arrowLeft`, `arrowRight`, `externalLink`) plus 14 modern infrastructure icons (`pod`, `deployment`, `service`, `node`, `ingress`, `cloud`, `container`, `firewall`, `shield`, `certificate`, `key`, `metrics`, `logs`, `trace`).
- **Composite off icons** — `eyeOff` and `bellOff` now reuse their base glyph plus a slash overlay, eliminating duplicated SVG paths.
- **Design token expansion** — new `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--text-*`, `--leading-*` and `--disabled-opacity` tokens across all six palettes/modes.
- **Loading states** — `StrctDatagrid`, `StrctTable` and `StrctCombobox` now accept a `[loading]` input and render skeleton placeholders.
- **Responsive breakpoint system** — new `--bp-sm/md/lg/xl` tokens plus mobile drawer for `StrctShell`, horizontal scroll for `StrctDatagrid`, scrollable tabs, responsive modal sizing and viewport-safe dropdowns.
- ** prefers-reduced-motion support** — global CSS reset disables animations and transitions when the user prefers reduced motion.
- **Icon accessibility** — `<strct-icon>` now accepts an `ariaLabel` input and exposes `role="img"` / `aria-hidden` accordingly.
- **Toast assertive announcements** — `critical` toasts now use `aria-live="assertive"` by default; other types remain `polite`.
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow runs lint, test and build on every push/PR.
- **Pre-commit hooks** — Husky + lint-staged run ESLint --fix and Prettier on staged files.
- **Bundle analysis** — `npm run bundle:analyze` generates a production build with source-map-explorer output.

### Changed

- **Unified semantic naming** — `danger` → `critical`, `ok` → `success`, `warn` → `warning`, `crt` → `critical` throughout types, CSS tokens, component APIs and documentation.
- `StrctModal.dismissable` renamed to `dismissible`.
- `ellipsis` icon removed (duplicate of `dots`).
- Production component-style budgets raised to 8 kB warning / 12 kB error.

### Added (tooling)

- ESLint with `@angular-eslint`, including template accessibility rules.
- 127 unit tests across 56 spec files (up from 9 spec files / 17 tests).
- JSDoc/TSDoc comments on all public APIs.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-04

Third feedback round. All additions are **backward-compatible**.

### Added

- **Per-node tree context menu** — `<strct-tree [nodeMenu]="fn">` takes a resolver
  `(node) => StrctMenuItem[]` and wires a `[strctContextMenu]` trigger on every node
  row; a new `(nodeMenuSelect)` output emits `{ node, item }`. Nodes whose resolver
  returns an empty array open no menu.

### Changed

- **Combobox** no longer caps its width at 280px (fills its container) and drops the
  dead absolute-position menu CSS that `StrctOverlay` already overrode.

### Fixed

- `StrctMenuItem.label` is now optional — a `divider` entry no longer needs a
  meaningless placeholder label.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-04

Second feedback round (SHOULD-FIX) — all additions are **backward-compatible**.

### Added

- **`strct-field`** — a form-field wrapper with label, required marker, hint and error
  message that auto-wires `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid` on the projected control.
- **Self-hosted fonts** — DM Sans and JetBrains Mono (OFL) now ship as `woff2` under
  `styles/fonts/` and are referenced by `@font-face` in the theme, so the library renders
  in its intended type with no external request.
- **Icons** — added `folder`, `template`, `tag`, `resourcePool` and `portGroup` glyphs.

### Changed

- **Modal** now locks body scroll while open (reference-counted for nested modals) and
  restores it on close / destroy.
- **Overlay** flips horizontally (`left` / `right` placements) when it would overflow the
  viewport edge, instead of only clamping.
- **Submenu** flips to the left near the right edge and can be opened via click / tap and
  the keyboard (Enter / Space / →, closed with ← / Esc), not hover only.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-04

Feedback-driven release — all additions are **backward-compatible**.

### Added

- **Datagrid / Table cell templates** — a `*strctCell="key"` template per column for
  custom cell content (status pills, links, action buttons). Context exposes
  `let-row`, `let-value="value"` and `let-column="column"`.
- **Datagrid `rowId`** — a stable row identity (property key or function) so selection,
  expansion and the active detail row survive live data re-fetches that replace the row
  objects. `selectionChange` now emits fresh row objects resolved by id.
- **Data-driven tree** — `<strct-tree [nodes]>` self-recurses over a `StrctTreeNodeData[]`
  of any depth, with a new `(nodeActivated)` output and a per-node `badge` input for object
  state on the node.
- **Data-driven context menu** — a new `[strctContextMenu]="items"` directive that portals
  into `<body>` (no overflow / transform clipping), positions by its real measured size,
  supports full keyboard navigation (↑/↓/→/←/Enter/Esc with roving tabindex) and nested
  submenus, and runs each item's `action`.
- **Wizard step validation** — a per-step `[canAdvance]` gate for Next / Finish, plus wizard
  `[submitting]`, `[cancelable]`, `[finishLabel]` inputs and `(cancelled)`, `(stepChange)`
  outputs.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Published documentation & demo site on GitHub Pages: <https://akcelik.github.io/uistruct/>.
- Link to the live documentation site in the package README.

_No component API changes in this release._

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- Initial public release of `@akcelik/strct`.
- **53 standalone, signal-based Angular components** across eight categories — Controls,
  Forms, Surfaces, Navigation, Data, Charts, Feedback and Patterns.
- **Tokenised theme system**: three palettes (Arctic, Ember, Sage) × light/dark, driven
  entirely by CSS custom properties bound to `[data-palette][data-theme]` on the document root.
- **Datacenter-flavoured stroke icon set** with object-state badges (running / stopped /
  maintenance / off) layered via the icon `badge` input, plus generic vendor marks.
- **ControlValueAccessor** support on every form control (input, checkbox, toggle, radio,
  slider, combobox, datepicker, password, file, color picker, cascade select, rating, chips,
  OTP, knob, input mask).
- Dependency-free SVG charts (sparkline, line / area / bar, donut, gauge).
- Overlay-safe dropdowns, tooltips and menus; accessible modal with focus trap.
- Zoneless, `OnPush` change detection throughout. MIT licensed.
